            An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone, is an aircraft without any human pilot, crew, or passengers on board. UAVs were originally developed through the twentieth century for military missions too "dull, dirty or dangerous"[1] for humans, and by the twenty-first, they had become essential assets to most militaries. As control technologies improved and costs fell, their use expanded to many non-military applications.[2] These include aerial photography, precision agriculture, forest fire monitoring,[3] river monitoring,[4][5] environmental monitoring,[6][7][8][9] policing and surveillance, infrastructure inspections, smuggling,[10] product deliveries, entertainment, and drone racing.
